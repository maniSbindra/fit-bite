# ML Experiment
* The objective of the ML exercise is to find the probability of the pet falling sick in the near future given various parameters that we monitor via sensors and the pets past history gathered from its visit to the veterinarian. The ML experiment Map is given below. The experiement is exposed as a webservice which is used by the Slack BOT to communicate health prediction of the pet to its owner (Via an Azure Function)
